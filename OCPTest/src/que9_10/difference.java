//Que - 9
//ArrayList use  java.util.ArrayList.indexOf(Object) for getting an element with Index.
//LinkedList use java.util.LinkedList.get(int index) for getting an element with Index.

// ArrayList is faster than LinkedList because ArrayList use Index based system for its elements
//where as LinkedList does not use Index based system. LinkedList iterates either from the beginning 
//or from the end(closer one) to retrieve the node at specified element Index.


//ArrayList use java.util.ArrayList.remove(Object) method to remove the first occurrence of the
//element if it is present.

//LinkedList use java.util.LinkedList.remove(Object o) method to remove the first occurrence of the
//element if it is present.

//ArrayList remove(int) method involves copying elements 
//from old array to new updated array.

//If we use remove() method on LinkedlList, it will remove the head of the list. We can pass integer
//or object in  the remove method. It will then unlink that node from the linked list.


// Que - 10 - C is the right answer.
